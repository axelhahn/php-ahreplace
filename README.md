# Replacer class

A PHP class to replace text elements.

The elements for replacements are kind of global replacements for the content
of your website, documentation, ...

The idea behind is to have shortcuts for snippets in your (html or md or ...) text.

You can 
* replace simple keywords with text (but for that you wouldn't need the class)
* cascade replacements
* use "parameters" in a replacement

The data what to to replace how can be read from multiple files to include
global replacements and more specific replacements for a project or a dependenncy.

This class can be useful in a parser or pre processor.

Free software and open source.
